In this blog, I want to explore how to design an IM, for designing and developing a IM system has always been my expectation, thus I have studied some IM system design and tried to design it. Here we go.

#### Here are some important questions to be answered

1. How to know someone is online?

2. How to transfer information in limited network environment, like 2G network

3. How to get the information informed

4. What if a server fail down?
5. What if there are large scale of network transport
